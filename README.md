# i_am_rich

A clone of the famous "I Am Rich" iOS mobile app by Armin Heinrich that had an extremely high price while ironically doing absolutely nothing but display an icon (more info: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Am_Rich). For Heinrich, this was a genious idea to scam rich people looking for a way to show off their wealth. For me, it serves as a good template to relearn the basics of Flutter for mobile app development.

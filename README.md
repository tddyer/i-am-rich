# Overview

A clone of the notorious "I Am Rich" iOS mobile app developed by Armin Heinrich that was famous for having an extremely high price while ironically doing absolutely nothing except display a single icon (for more info: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Am_Rich). For Heinrich, this was a genious idea to scam wealthy people looking for a way to show off their wealth (or naive children wanting expensive things). For me, it serves as a good template to relearn the basics of Flutter for mobile app development.
